# 🏰 Idle Dynasty Builder - Gameplay Guide

## Overview
Idle Dynasty Builder is a strategic city-building and exploration game where you manage resources, expand your settlement, and lead expeditions to conquer new territories.

## Getting Started

### 1. Dynasty Creation
- Choose your dynasty name when starting
- This represents your royal lineage and appears in game lore
- Cannot be changed once set, so choose wisely!

### 2. Starting State
- You begin with **1 royal** and **4 basic villagers** (5 total population)
- **No buildings** - you must construct everything from scratch
- **Population cap starts at 0** - only buildings and technology can increase capacity
- **Jobs are derived from buildings** - villagers get roles based on constructed buildings
- **Starting resources**: Wood, food, and stone to begin construction
- Your immediate priority is building shelter to house your population before they face penalties

### 3. First Steps Tutorial
- Learn basic building placement
- Understand resource management
- Get familiar with the game interface

## Core Mechanics

### Resource System
The game revolves around four primary resources:
- 🌾 **Food**: Sustains population and armies
- 🪵 **Wood**: Essential for construction
- 🪨 **Stone**: Required for advanced buildings
- 🪙 **Gold**: Enables trade and military recruitment

### Population Management
- **Jobs are assigned based on buildings** - construct buildings to create job opportunities
- Houses provide **6 population capacity** each
- Town centers provide storage and administrative functions
- Balance population growth with resource consumption and housing capacity
- Unemployed population can be drafted for military service
- Population without adequate housing capacity may face happiness penalties
- **Construction System**: Buildings require work points and builder assignment to complete

### Construction System
The game uses a work-point based construction system:

#### Construction Process
1. **Place Building**: Select a building type and place it on the village grid
2. **Assign Builders**: Buildings require builders to accumulate work points daily
3. **Track Progress**: Construction sites show progress bars and estimated completion time
4. **Complete Building**: Once work points are met, building becomes functional and provides jobs

#### Builder Management
- Builders are assigned through the job management system
- Multiple builders can work on the same construction site for faster completion
- Construction progress is saved and persists across game sessions
- **Haste Runes** can be used to boost construction speed village-wide

#### Effects and Bonuses
- **Haste Runes**: Provide temporary construction speed multipliers
- **Seasonal Variations**: Some seasons may affect construction efficiency  
- **Building Synergies**: Certain buildings provide bonuses to nearby construction

## Buildings Guide

### Core Buildings

#### 🏛️ Town Center (Command Hub)
- **Purpose**: Strategic command center and logistics coordination
- **Function**: Supply distribution, army marshaling, expedition management
- **Bonus**: +10% efficiency to all village production per level
- **Special**: Cannot be destroyed, required for military operations
- **Strategy**: Upgrade to improve overall village efficiency and unlock advanced military options

#### 🏠 House (Population)
- **Purpose**: Increases available population
- **Resource Cost**: Wood, some maintenance food
- **Strategy**: Build early to support other buildings
- **Scaling**: Each level increases capacity

#### 🌾 Farm (Food Production)
- **Purpose**: Primary food generation
- **Resource Cost**: Wood to build, produces food daily
- **Strategy**: Essential for population growth and army supply
- **Efficiency**: Higher levels produce more food per worker

#### 🪵 Woodcutter Lodge (Wood Production)
- **Purpose**: Harvests and processes lumber
- **Resource Cost**: Food for workers
- **Strategy**: Critical for construction projects
- **Location**: Best placed near forest tiles

#### 🪨 Quarry (Stone Production)
- **Purpose**: Mines stone for advanced construction
- **Resource Cost**: Food and wood for operation
- **Strategy**: Required for defensive structures and upgrades
- **Efficiency**: Slower production but valuable output

#### 🏪 Market (Gold Generation)
- **Purpose**: Trade hub generating gold income
- **Resource Cost**: Multiple resources for upkeep
- **Strategy**: Build when you have surplus production
- **Scaling**: Higher levels unlock better trade routes

#### ⚔️ Barracks (Military)
- **Purpose**: Trains and houses military units
- **Resource Cost**: High upkeep in all resources
- **Strategy**: Essential for expeditions and defense
- **Function**: Drafts population into army units

## World Exploration

### Hexagonal World Map
- Navigate between different regions
- Each hex represents a potential settlement location
- Resources and challenges vary by region
- Strategic positioning affects trade and military logistics

### Expeditions
- Launch from your Town Center
- Require adequate supply lines
- Success depends on army strength and preparation
- Rewards include new territories and resources

### Army Management
- Draft population from your village
- Train units at the Barracks
- Supply armies through Town Center logistics
- Balance military needs with civilian production

## Strategic Tips

### Early Game (Levels 1-5)
1. Focus on basic resource production (Farm, Woodcutter Lodge)
2. Build Houses to support population growth
3. Complete the tutorial to understand mechanics
4. Avoid military expansion until economy is stable

### Mid Game (Levels 6-15)
1. Establish Market for gold income
2. Build Quarry for stone production
3. Begin upgrading existing buildings
4. Consider first military expansion

### Late Game (Levels 16+)
1. Focus on military conquest
2. Establish supply networks between territories
3. Optimize building efficiency through upgrades
4. Plan large-scale expedition campaigns

## Resource Management Tips

### Balancing Production
- Monitor daily resource changes
- Ensure positive food production before expansion
- Plan construction projects around resource availability
- Use Market to convert surplus production to gold

### Supply Chain Efficiency
- Position buildings strategically for supply bonuses
- Upgrade Town Center to boost overall efficiency
- Plan building placement to minimize transport costs
- Consider worker allocation and building placement

### Economic Cycles
- Resources fluctuate based on building activity
- Plan for seasonal variations in production
- Maintain strategic reserves for emergencies
- Balance growth with stability

## Military Strategy

### Army Composition
- Balance unit types for different situations
- Consider supply requirements for sustained campaigns
- Plan recruitment around population availability
- Maintain reserves for defense

### Expedition Planning
- Assess target difficulty before attacking
- Ensure adequate supply lines
- Plan retreat routes and fallback positions
- Coordinate timing with resource production

### Logistics Management
- Town Center coordinates all supply operations
- Plan expedition timing around harvest cycles
- Maintain supply depots for extended campaigns
- Consider weather and terrain effects

## Advanced Strategies

### Multi-Settlement Management
- Balance resources between settlements
- Establish trade routes for resource sharing
- Coordinate military operations across territories
- Plan expansion routes strategically

### Optimization Techniques
- Analyze building ROI (Return on Investment)
- Minimize resource waste through careful planning
- Use idle time for infrastructure improvements
- Plan upgrades to maximize efficiency gains

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Negative Resources**: Reduce building activity or increase production
- **Population Shortage**: Build more Houses or reduce military recruitment
- **Military Failures**: Improve army supply or increase training
- **Slow Progress**: Focus on efficiency upgrades and building optimization

### Performance Tips
- Regular save file management
- Monitor resource trends over time
