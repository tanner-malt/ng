# üéØ New Scout Expedition System - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ **Issues Fixed**

### **Wood Consumption Problem**
- **FIXED**: Reduced building maintenance from 10% to 2% of build cost per day
- **RESULT**: Wood consumption should drop dramatically (from ~65/day to ~13/day)
- **REASONING**: 10% daily maintenance was too aggressive for gameplay balance

### **Production Planner Cleanup**
- **REMOVED**: Resource Goals section (üéØ Resource Goals)
- **REMOVED**: Efficiency bars and statistics (üìä Efficiency)
- **KEPT**: Only the Crafting Queue (‚öîÔ∏è Crafting Queue)
- **RESULT**: Cleaner, more focused production planner
