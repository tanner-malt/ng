# Multi-Building Placement Feature - Implementation Summary

## üèóÔ∏è Feature Description
Modified the building system so that players can place multiple buildings of the same type without having to reselect from the build menu, as long as they have sufficient resources.

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. Modified Grid Click Handler (`src/village.js`)
- **Location**: Lines ~540-570 in `setupGridClick()` method
- **Change**: After placing a building, check if player can still afford another of the same type
- **Behavior**: 
  - If affordable: Stay in build mode and show helpful toast
  - If not affordable: Exit build mode as before
  - During tutorial: Always exit build mode to avoid confusion

### 2. Updated Building Placement Logic (`src/village.js`)
- **Location**: `placeBuilding()` method around line 740
- **Change**: Removed automatic `exitBuildMode()` call
- **Reason**: Build mode exit is now handled by the caller for better control

### 3. Added Building Button State Updates (`src/village.js`)
- **Location**: New `updateBuildingButtonStates()` method around line 325
- **Purpose**: Update button affordability/availability after resource changes
- **Called**: After each building placement to reflect current resource state

### 4. Enhanced User Feedback
- **Toast Notification**: Informs players they can build another building
- **Button State Updates**: Visual feedback showing which buildings are still affordable
- **Tutorial Awareness**: Disabled during tutorial to prevent confusion

## üéØ User Experience Improvements

1. **Continuous Building**: Players can rapidly place multiple buildings without menu navigation
2. **Clear Feedback**: Toast messages and button states indicate when multi-building is available
3. **Smart Exit**: Automatically exits build mode when resources are exhausted
4. **Tutorial Safe**: Preserves original behavior during tutorial steps
5. **Existing Controls**: Escape key and right-click still exit build mode manually

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Basic Testing
1. Open the game and complete/skip tutorial
2. Ensure you have resources for multiple buildings
3. Select a building type from the menu
4. Place multiple buildings rapidly
5. Verify build mode stays active until resources are exhausted

### Edge Case Testing
1. **Tutorial Mode**: Verify single-building behavior during tutorial
2. **Resource Depletion**: Confirm auto-exit when can't afford more
3. **Manual Exit**: Test Escape key and right-click still work
4. **Button States**: Check building buttons update correctly

### Developer Testing Commands
```javascript
// Add resources for testing
window.gameState.resources.gold += 1000;
window.gameState.resources.wood += 1000;
window.gameState.resources.stone += 1000;
window.gameState.resources.food += 1000;

// Refresh UI
window.villageManager.updateBuildingButtonStates();
```

## üîß Technical Details

### Key Code Changes
- **Grid Click Handler**: Added resource check logic after building placement
- **Build Mode Management**: Conditional exit based on affordability and tutorial state
- **UI Updates**: Automatic button state refresh after resource expenditure
- **User Feedback**: Toast notifications for multi-building availability

### Preserved Functionality
- Tutorial progression events still fire correctly
- All existing building placement validation remains
- Manual build mode exit methods unchanged
- Achievement and unlock systems unaffected

## üìù Files Modified
- `/src/village.js` - Main building placement logic
- `/test_multi_building.html` - Test file for validation

This implementation provides a smooth, intuitive building experience while maintaining all existing game mechanics and tutorial functionality.
