# 🔧 Village Grid Building System - Bug Fixes

## 🐛 **Issues Identified & Fixed**

### **Problem 1: Ghost Building Preview Not Following Grid Movement**
- **Issue**: When dragging the village grid, the building preview (ghost building) would appear in wrong positions
- **Root Cause**: Mouse coordinates weren't adjusted for view offset during dragging
- **Fix**: Updated `mouseMoveHandler` in `setupBuildPreview()` to account for `viewOffsetX` and `viewOffsetY`

**Before:**
```javascript
const x = Math.floor((e.clientX - rect.left) / this.gridSize) * this.gridSize;
const y = Math.floor((e.clientY - rect.top) / this.gridSize) * this.gridSize;
```

**After:**
```javascript
const offsetX = this.viewOffsetX || 0;
const offsetY = this.viewOffsetY || 0;
const x = Math.floor((e.clientX - rect.left - offsetX) / this.gridSize) * this.gridSize;
const y = Math.floor((e.clientY - rect.top - offsetY) / this.gridSize) * this.gridSize;
```

### **Problem 2: Ghost Building Added to Wrong Container**
- **Issue**: Ghost buildings were added to main grid instead of grid content container
- **Root Cause**: Using `this.villageGrid.appendChild()` instead of `this.villageGridContent.appendChild()`
- **Fix**: Ghost buildings now properly added to the moveable content container

**Before:**
```javascript
this.villageGrid.appendChild(ghostBuilding);
```

**After:**
```javascript
this.villageGridContent.appendChild(ghostBuilding);
```

### **Problem 3: Building Bounds Too Restrictive**
- **Issue**: Build area was limited to viewport size instead of full content area
- **Root Cause**: `isWithinBounds()` used viewport dimensions, not content area
- **Fix**: Expanded bounds to allow building in full 200% content area

**Before:**
```javascript
return x >= 0 && y >= 0 && x < rect.width - this.gridSize && y < rect.height - this.gridSize;
```

**After:**
```javascript
const maxX = 1600; // Allow building up to 1600px x coordinate
const maxY = 1200; // Allow building up to 1200px y coordinate
return x >= 0 && y >= 0 && x < maxX && y < maxY;
```

## ✅ **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Grid System Architecture**
- **Viewport**: Fixed-size container (`village-grid`) that shows portion of content
- **Content Area**: Larger moveable container (`village-grid-content`) at 200% size
- **Grid Background**: CSS `linear-gradient` with 50px spacing to match `gridSize`
- **Dragging**: Transform-based movement that shifts entire content container

### **Coordinate System**
- **Grid Size**: 50px per cell (matches CSS background grid)
- **Mouse Coordinates**: Adjusted for view offset during building placement
- **Building Positions**: Snapped to 50px grid alignment
- **Container Reference**: `getGridContainer()` returns correct container for buildings

### **Building Placement Flow**
1. **Enter Build Mode**: Click building button → `enterBuildMode(buildingType)`
2. **Ghost Preview**: Mouse movement shows preview at correct grid position
3. **Coordinate Adjustment**: Account for dragging offset in position calculation
4. **Bounds Check**: Verify position within expanded content area
5. **Placement**: Add building to grid content container (not viewport)

### **Dragging Behavior**
- **Start**: Mouse down on grid (not in build mode)
- **Movement**: Content container translates via CSS transform
- **Bounds**: Limited to ±400px offset to prevent excessive panning
- **Reset**: Double-click returns to center position (0, 0)

## 🎮 **User Experience Improvements**

### **Before Fixes**
- ❌ Ghost building would appear in wrong location when grid was dragged
- ❌ Limited build area confined to initial viewport
- ❌ Inconsistent coordinate system between dragging and building

### **After Fixes**
- ✅ Ghost building follows cursor correctly regardless of grid position
- ✅ Large build area accessible via dragging and exploration
- ✅ Consistent grid alignment and snapping behavior
- ✅ Smooth dragging with proper bounds and reset functionality

## 🔍 **Validation Points**

To verify fixes are working:
1. **Enter build mode** for any building type
2. **Drag the grid** to move view around
3. **Move mouse over grid** - ghost building should appear at correct grid positions
4. **Click to place** - building should appear exactly where ghost was shown
5. **Drag again** - placed buildings should move with the grid content
6. **Double-click** - grid should reset to center position

The coordinate system now properly handles the viewport/content separation, ensuring building placement works intuitively regardless of how far the user has panned the village view.
