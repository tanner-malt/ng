# Death Report System & Blacksmith Building Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds two major features to the Dynasty Builder game:

1. **Death Report System** - Provides analytics on expected population deaths with daily/monthly views
2. **Blacksmith Building** - A new building that produces metal and provides production efficiency bonuses

## üßì Death Report System

### Features
- **Death Prediction Analytics**: Calculates expected deaths based on villager ages (death occurs at 198 days)
- **Risk Categorization**: Groups villagers by death risk (Imminent, Very High, High, Moderate, Low)
- **Dual Timeframes**: Toggle between daily and monthly death projections
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Shows individual villagers at risk with their ages
- **Population Overview**: Displays total population statistics and risk percentages

### Technical Implementation

#### PopulationManager Enhancement
**File**: `src/populationManager.js`
- Added `calculateExpectedDeaths(timeframe)` method
- Returns comprehensive death risk analysis
- Categorizes villagers into 5 risk groups based on age proximity to death (198 days)

#### GameState Integration
**File**: `src/gameState.js`
- Added `getDeathReportData(timeframe)` method
- Provides interface between PopulationManager and UI systems
- Handles data validation and error cases

#### Modal System Enhancement
**File**: `src/modalSystem.js`
- Added `showDeathReportModal(gameState, timeframe)` method
- Added `generateDeathReportContent(gameState, timeframe)` method
- Added `switchDeathReportTimeframe(timeframe)` method
- Responsive modal design with comprehensive statistics display

#### Village Manager Integration
**File**: `src/village.js`
- Added death report button setup in `init()` method
- Added `setupDeathReportButton()` method
- Added `showDeathReport()` method
- Integrated with existing population management UI

#### UI Integration
**File**: `public/game.html`
- Added death report button to population actions section
- Button positioned alongside existing "View Population" button

#### Styling
**File**: `public/game.css`
- Added comprehensive modal styling for death report
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Color-coded risk categories
- Interactive timeframe toggle buttons

### Usage
1. Navigate to Village view
2. In the Population section of Village Manager (right panel)
3. Click "üíÄ Death Report" button
4. Toggle between "üìÖ Daily View" and "üìä Monthly View"
5. Review risk categories and individual villager details

## ‚öíÔ∏è Blacksmith Building

### Features
- **Metal Production**: Produces 6 metal per day
- **Efficiency Bonus**: Provides 20% boost to all production
- **Strategic Positioning**: Unlocked after Market building
- **Resource Requirements**: Costs 80 wood, 40 stone, 30 metal
- **Construction Time**: Takes 4 days to complete

### Technical Implementation

#### Game Data Configuration
**File**: `src/gameData.js`
- Added blacksmith to `buildingCosts` (80 wood, 40 stone, 30 metal)
- Added blacksmith to `buildingProduction` (6 metal/day, 1.2x efficiency multiplier)
- Added blacksmith to `constructionTimes` (4 days)
- Added blacksmith to `buildingInfo` (icon: ‚öíÔ∏è, name, description)
- Enhanced quarry to produce metal (2 metal/day) to enable metal economy
- Added starting metal (5) to make metal-requiring buildings accessible

#### Building Unlock Progression
**File**: `src/gameState.js`
- Added complete building unlock chain:
  - townCenter ‚Üí house ‚Üí farm ‚Üí barracks ‚Üí workshop ‚Üí sawmill ‚Üí quarry ‚Üí market ‚Üí **blacksmith** ‚Üí temple ‚Üí academy ‚Üí castle ‚Üí university
- Blacksmith unlocks after Market is built

#### Visual Integration
**File**: `src/village.js`
- Added blacksmith symbol (‚öíÔ∏è) to `getBuildingSymbol()` method
- Added symbols for all other buildings for consistency
- Ensures proper visual representation on the village grid

### Building Progression Path
To unlock the Blacksmith, players must build:
1. Town Center
2. House
3. Farm
4. Barracks
5. Workshop
6. Sawmill
7. Quarry (now produces metal)
8. Market
9. **Blacksmith** (unlocked)

### Economic Impact
- **Metal Economy**: Establishes a proper metal production chain (Quarry ‚Üí Blacksmith)
- **Production Boost**: 20% efficiency increase affects all resource generation
- **Strategic Value**: High-cost building with significant long-term benefits

## üß™ Testing

Created comprehensive test files:
- `test_death_report.html` - Tests death report calculation logic
- `test_blacksmith.html` - Validates blacksmith building data
- `test_complete_functionality.html` - Full integration testing

### Test Coverage
- ‚úÖ Death report calculations (daily/monthly)
- ‚úÖ Risk categorization accuracy
- ‚úÖ Modal system integration
- ‚úÖ Blacksmith building data integrity
- ‚úÖ Building unlock progression
- ‚úÖ UI button integration
- ‚úÖ Visual symbol rendering

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

All changes are fully backward compatible:
- Existing save games will continue to work
- No breaking changes to existing systems
- New features are additive only
- Graceful degradation when PopulationManager unavailable

## üì± Responsive Design

Both features include mobile-responsive design:
- Death report modal adapts to smaller screens
- Buttons resize appropriately for touch interfaces
- Grid layouts adjust for different viewport sizes

## üéØ User Experience

### Death Report Benefits
- **Strategic Planning**: Helps players anticipate population changes
- **Resource Allocation**: Plan for population replacement needs
- **Immersive Gameplay**: Adds realistic demographic management

### Blacksmith Benefits
- **Economic Depth**: Introduces metal as a strategic resource
- **Progression Satisfaction**: Meaningful late-game building unlock
- **Production Optimization**: Rewarding efficiency improvements

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Death Report System
- Add death prevention mechanics (healthcare buildings)
- Implement death notifications with detailed statistics
- Add historical death tracking and trends

### Blacksmith Building
- Add weapon/tool crafting mechanics
- Implement building upgrade system
- Add specialized metal types (iron, steel, etc.)

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Code Organization
- Functions follow existing naming conventions
- Error handling implemented throughout
- Console logging for debugging
- Comprehensive documentation

### Performance Considerations
- Death calculations are lightweight and efficient
- Modal content generated on-demand
- No performance impact on core game loop

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatible
- Color-blind friendly design

This implementation successfully delivers both requested features while maintaining code quality, user experience, and system integration standards.
