# Migration Note: Job-Driven Production

Date: 2025-08-25

We removed legacy direct resource outputs from `GameData.buildingProduction`.
Production is now exclusively generated by workers through the Job system.

What changed:
- Removed fields like `food`, `wood`, `stone`, `metal`, `planks`, `gold`, `research`, etc. from building definitions.
- Kept and expanded `jobs`, `storage`, `populationCapacity`, and efficiency-style bonuses.
- Updated building descriptions to reflect job-driven behavior.

Why:
- Align building capabilities to a clear model: storage, jobs, pop cap, bonuses.
- Apply seasonal multipliers to job outputs only; storage is season-invariant.

Impact:
- UIs or scripts that read direct outputs from `GameData.buildingProduction` should switch to using the JobManager’s production calculations.
- GameState’s `computeDailyBuildingProduction()` remains for legacy but should be retired.

Next steps (optional):
- Remove or hide any UI that still lists direct per-building outputs.
- Add tests for job-driven production totals where relevant.
