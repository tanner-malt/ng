# 🎮 Getting Started

**Welcome to Idle: Dynasty Builder!** You are the founder of a royal dynasty, responsible for managing your settlement, growing your population, and leading your family through generations of conquest and expansion.

## 📍 Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Build structures** in your village to enable resource production
2. **Manage your village** day by day as time advances and seasons change
3. **Expand your dynasty** through marriages, heirs, and territorial growth
4. **Lead royal expeditions** to explore the world and conquer new territories
5. **Plan for succession** as your dynasty passes from ruler to ruler across generations

## 🏗️ Your First Steps

### Essential Buildings
- **Town Center:** Build first - enables population growth and core management
- **Houses:** Increase population capacity for your growing settlement
- **Farms:** Food production for your population (also unlocks Monarch view)
- **Barracks:** Train army units and unlock expedition capabilities

### Early Game Progression
1. **Start Small:** Focus on basic resource production and population growth
2. **Unlock Features:** Build a Farm to access advanced Monarch governance tools
3. **Build Military:** Construct Barracks to enable expeditions and territorial expansion
4. **Plan Dynasty:** Begin thinking about marriages and heir development

## 👑 Royal Dynasty System

You begin as the founding **Monarch** of your dynasty, with unique royal privileges:

- **🏘️ Territorial Management:** Oversee construction, resource production, and population growth
- **⚔️ Military Leadership:** Personally lead expeditions and command armies in battle
- **📜 Royal Quests:** Complete special missions and achieve dynastic objectives
- **💍 Marriage & Heirs:** Build your royal family through strategic alliances and bloodline management

### Time & Seasons
- **Daily Progression:** Time advances day by day, with each expedition tile representing one day of travel
- **Seasonal Cycles:** Every 30 days brings seasonal changes affecting resource production
- **Generational Play:** Your dynasty continues through multiple rulers as monarchs age and heirs inherit

### Royal Expedition Requirements
**Important:** Only royal family members (monarchs and heirs) can lead expeditions in the early game. The ability to send governors or military commanders is unlocked through advanced achievements.

> **💡 Dynasty Tip:** Your monarch is powerful but irreplaceable in early game! Plan expeditions carefully - losing your ruler before establishing heirs could end your dynasty.
