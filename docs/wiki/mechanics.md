# ⚙️ Game Mechanics

## ⏰ Time & Seasons

Time advances day by day. The year consists of 8 seasonal periods (200 days total) with resource production modifiers and storage capacity limits:

### Major Seasons (30 days each)
- **🌸 Spring:** +20% Food production
- **☀️ Summer:** +50% Food, -20% Wood, +20% Stone  
- **🍂 Autumn:** +30% Wood production
- **❄️ Winter:** -30% Food, +50% Wood, -20% Stone

### Transitional Seasons (10 days each)
- **� Sprummer:** +35% Food, -10% Wood, +10% Stone (Spring → Summer transition)
- **� Sumtumn:** +25% Food, +15% Wood (Summer → Autumn transition)
- **� Autinter:** +20% Wood, -10% Food (Autumn → Winter transition)
- **❄️ Winting:** +25% Wood, -20% Food, -10% Stone (Winter → Spring transition)

**Resource Management:** Each resource type has storage capacity limits that require strategic planning. Build storage buildings to increase capacity and prevent waste during productive seasons. The short transitional seasons create urgent decision points for resource allocation.

## 👑 Royal Dynasty Leadership

Royal family members manage different aspects of your dynasty with specialized roles:

- **👑 Monarch (Ruling Leader):** Primary ruler with full authority over all aspects of the dynasty
- **🏰 Village Management:** Oversee construction, resource production, and population growth
- **⚔️ Military Leadership:** Lead expeditions, command armies, and conduct military campaigns
- **📜 Royal Quests:** Complete dynastic missions and achieve long-term objectives
- **💍 Dynasty Building:** Arrange marriages, manage heirs, and plan succession

**Leadership Evolution:** Early game requires the monarch to personally handle all major decisions. Later unlocks allow governors and military commanders to take on specialized roles, freeing the royal family for strategic planning.

### Skill Development
**Royal family members gain experience through daily activities:**
- **Management Experience:** Gained by overseeing village operations each day
- **Military Experience:** Earned through leading expeditions and commanding battles
- **Construction Experience:** Developed by directing building projects
- **Diplomatic Experience:** Acquired through quest completion and alliance management

**Advanced Training:** Later in the game, specialized training buildings allow accelerated skill development and focused education for royal family members.

## 👥 Population Demographics

The civilian population is managed through age cohorts that create strategic demographic challenges:

### Age Cohorts & Productivity
- **👶 Baby (0-5 years):** No productivity, requires care and resources
- **🧒 Child (6-15 years):** Limited productivity, can perform simple tasks
- **👨 Young Adult (16-30 years):** Full productivity, prime working age
- **👩 Adult (31-70 years):** Full productivity, experienced workers
- **🧓 Middle Aged (71-100 years):** Reduced productivity, wisdom bonuses
- **👴 Elder (101-1120 years):** Minimal productivity, advisor roles

### Population Dynamics
- **Capacity:** Each house increases capacity by 15 (tripled from base 5)
- **Aging:** Citizens age naturally and die after 120 years
- **Growth:** Baby production depends on adult population, food availability, and happiness
- **Collapse Risk:** Poor demographic planning can lead to population collapse as cohorts age out

### Strategic Management
**Population collapse prevention requires:**
- Maintaining healthy adult population for reproduction
- Ensuring adequate food and housing for growing families
- Planning for generational transitions as workers age
- Balancing immediate labor needs with long-term demographic health

## ⚔️ Expeditions

Royal family members lead armies to distant locations for exploration, conquest, and territorial expansion:

1. **Royal Leadership:** Monarch or heir must personally lead the expedition (early game requirement)
2. **Daily Travel:** Each map tile represents one day of journey with potential events
3. **Supply Management:** Carry all needed resources and equipment from home base
4. **Battle Phase:** Fight enemies at destination using expedition-modified combat
5. **Return Journey:** Navigate back with spoils, conquered territory, and surviving forces

**Risk vs Reward:** Expeditions offer great rewards but risk losing valuable royal family members. Plan carefully and maintain multiple heirs for dynasty security.

## 🏰 Civilian vs Royal Population

The game features two distinct population management systems:

### Civilian Population
- **Demographic Management:** Age through cohorts from baby to elder (120-year lifespan)
- **Natural Growth:** Reproduction based on adult population, resources, and happiness
- **Workforce:** Provides labor for resource production, construction, and basic military units
- **Skills:** Can be trained in specialized civilian skills for increased efficiency

### Royal Population  
- **Bloodline Management:** Tracked separately with genetic traits and inheritance
- **Strategic Marriages:** Player-controlled courtship and alliance-building
- **Leadership Roles:** Serve as monarchs, heirs, governors, and military commanders
- **Social Mobility:** Exceptional civilians can marry into royal family, becoming royal members

**Population Integration:** While managed separately, both systems interact through royal governance, military recruitment, and the potential for civilians to join the royal bloodline through marriage.
