# 💰 Resources Player Guide

## 📊 Essential Resources

### 💰 Gold
Your primary currency for expansion and military operations
- **Sources:** Markets, expeditions, trade
- **Uses:** Building construction, training units, expedition costs
- **💡 Pro Tip:** Markets generate steady gold income - prioritize them early!

### 🌾 Food
Life force of your kingdom - essential for population growth
- **Sources:** Farms, expeditions, idle villagers
- **Uses:** Population growth, unit upkeep, expeditions
- **⚠️ Critical:** Negative food = population decline! Always maintain surplus

### 🌲 Wood
Your basic building material for early expansion
- **Sources:** Woodcutter lodges, expeditions, idle villagers
- **Uses:** Most building construction, basic upgrades
- **💡 Strategy:** Build multiple woodcutter lodges early for rapid expansion

### 🪨 Stone
Durable material for advanced structures
- **Sources:** Quarries, expeditions, idle villagers
- **Uses:** Advanced buildings, fortifications, upgrades
- **💡 Timing:** Start quarry production before building advanced structures

### ⚒️ Metal
Specialized resource for weapons and elite buildings
- **Sources:** Mines, blacksmiths, expeditions, idle villagers
- **Uses:** Weapons, armor, advanced buildings, upgrades
- **⭐ Elite:** Required for military superiority and late-game buildings

### ⚙️ Production
Industrial resource for crafting equipment
- **Sources:** Workshop (3/day), Blacksmith (4/day), Woodcutter Lodge (1/day), Quarry (1/day)
- **Uses:** Crafting weapons (5⚙️), tools (3⚙️), armor (8⚙️)
- **💡 Crafting:** Combine with gold to create powerful equipment

### 🪵 Lumber (Planks)
Processed wood for premium construction
- **Sources:** Lumber Mills (converts 4 wood → 6 planks)
- **Uses:** Advanced buildings, premium upgrades
- **⚒️ Workers:** Requires skilled lumberjacks for maximum efficiency

### 🧪 Research Points (RP)
Knowledge currency for technological advancement
- **Sources:** Libraries, scholars, court research
- **Uses:** Unlocking technologies, innovations, advanced buildings
- **🔬 Innovation:** Key to accessing late-game content

## 🔄 Production System

### ⚡ How Production Works
Your buildings automatically generate resources when staffed with workers:

1. **Worker Assignment:** Buildings need workers to operate (see [Population Management](population-management.md))
2. **Skill Efficiency:** Worker skills directly impact production rates
3. **Building Levels:** Higher level buildings produce more resources
4. **Seasonal Effects:** Production varies with the seasons

### 🏗️ Building Efficiency
Production rates scale with building level and worker skills:
- **Base Production:** Each building has a baseline output
- **Level Bonus:** +50% production per building level
- **Town Center Bonus:** +10% efficiency per Town Center level
- **Worker Skills:** Skilled workers significantly boost output

### 🌅 Seasonal Variations
Resource production changes with the seasons:

#### 🌸 Spring (30 days)
- **Food:** +20% (growing season begins)
- **Wood/Stone:** Normal rates

#### ☀️ Summer (30 days) 
- **Food:** +50% (peak harvest)
- **Wood:** -20% (dry conditions)
- **Stone:** +20% (ideal quarrying)

#### 🍂 Autumn (30 days)
- **Food:** Normal (harvest ending)
- **Wood:** +30% (ideal logging)
- **Stone:** Normal rates

#### ❄️ Winter (30 days)
- **Food:** -30% (harsh conditions)
- **Wood:** +50% (indoor processing)
- **Stone:** -20% (frozen ground)

*📅 Note: Transitional seasons (10 days each) provide gradual changes between major seasons*

### 👥 Idle Population Contribution
Unemployed working-age villagers (16-190 years) automatically contribute resources:
- **40% chance:** +0.5 Food daily
- **20% chance:** +0.5 Wood daily  
- **20% chance:** +0.25 Stone daily
- **20% chance:** +0.1 Metal daily

## 💡 Strategic Tips

### 🎯 Early Game Priority
1. **Food Security:** Build farms first - hungry villagers = no growth
2. **Wood Production:** Multiple woodcutter lodges for building materials
3. **Population Growth:** Houses to support larger workforce

### ⚖️ Mid Game Balance
1. **Diversification:** Balance all resource types
2. **Skill Development:** Train workers in specialized roles
3. **Seasonal Planning:** Stockpile resources during productive seasons

### 🏆 Late Game Optimization
1. **Production Resource:** Focus on crafting equipment
2. **Advanced Materials:** Lumber and metal for elite buildings
3. **Research Investment:** Libraries for technological advancement

### 🔧 Troubleshooting Production
- **Low Output?** Check worker assignments and skill levels
- **Seasonal Struggles?** Plan stockpiles during productive seasons
- **Resource Shortage?** Send expeditions for emergency supplies
