# Expeditions

Expeditions are one of the most important and engaging features in Idle Dynasty Builder, allowing you to send forces beyond your borders to explore, conquer, and gather resources. This Oregon Trail-inspired system adds depth and strategic planning to your empire building.

## Overview

Once unlocked through achievements, expeditions let you venture into the unknown lands surrounding your dynasty. Each expedition is a multi-phase journey that tests your leadership, resource management, and military prowess. Every tile on the world map represents one day of travel, and the game advances day by day during expeditions.

## Unlocking Expeditions

To access expeditions, you must:
- Complete the "Military Establishment" achievement (build your first Barracks)
- Have at least 1 Barracks constructed
- This unlocks the expedition features throughout the game

**Royal Leadership Requirement**: In the early game, expeditions must be led by royal family members (monarchs or heirs). The ability to send governors or military commanders on expeditions is unlocked later in the game through advanced achievements and technologies.

## Expedition Phases

### 1. Planning Phase
- **Choose Your Destination**: Select from available locations on the world map
- **Select Royal Leader**: Choose which royal family member will lead the expedition
- **Assemble Forces**: Decide how many soldiers to send
- **Gather Supplies**: Ensure adequate food, equipment, and resources
- **Pack Inventory Items**: Bring specific equipment like siege towers, magical artifacts, or specialized tools
- **Set Objectives**: Different locations offer different rewards and challenges

### 2. Traveling Out
During the outbound journey, your expedition faces various events and challenges:

**Travel Actions**:
- **Continue March**: Standard pace, balanced risk and progress
- **Force March**: Faster travel but reduces morale and increases supply consumption
- **Rest Army**: Restore morale and health but consumes time and supplies
- **Hunt for Food**: Attempt to gather additional supplies from the wilderness

**Random Events**:
- Weather challenges (storms, extreme temperatures)
- Terrain obstacles (rivers, mountains, dense forests)
- Wildlife encounters (both dangerous and beneficial)
- Equipment failures requiring repairs
- Discoveries of useful resources or shortcuts

### 3. Battle Phase
Upon reaching your destination, you may encounter:
- **Hostile Forces**: Enemy camps, bandits, or rival factions
- **Defensive Positions**: Fortified locations requiring siege tactics
- **Neutral Encounters**: Opportunities for trade or diplomacy
- **Empty Locations**: Safe exploration and resource gathering

Combat uses your established battle system but with expedition-specific modifiers based on:
- Army morale and health
- Remaining supplies
- Distance from home
- Terrain advantages/disadvantages

### 4. Traveling Back
The return journey brings its own challenges:
- **Heavier Loads**: Carrying loot and spoils slows movement
- **Pursuit**: Enemies may follow and attack during retreat
- **Supply Depletion**: Longer expeditions strain resources
- **Desertion Risk**: Low morale may cause soldiers to abandon the expedition

## Expedition Failure & Consequences

Expeditions can fail in various degrees of severity:

**Battle Failures**:
- **Total Defeat**: Entire army wiped out, royal leader killed or captured
- **Heavy Casualties**: Majority of forces lost, survivors attempt retreat
- **Pyrrhic Victory**: Victory achieved but at devastating cost
- **Tactical Retreat**: Organized withdrawal with partial force preservation

**Pursuit and Escape**:
- Surviving forces may face enemy pursuit during retreat
- Low morale and injuries make escape more difficult
- Some survivors may be captured or killed during the chase
- Royal leaders face higher risk if expedition fails catastrophically

**Dynasty Impact**:
- Lost royal family members affect succession planning
- Military defeats damage your reputation and diplomatic standing
- Economic losses from failed expeditions can cripple expansion
- Successful rescues of failed expeditions become legendary achievements

## Supply Management & Inventory

**Essential Supplies**:
- **Food**: Prevents hunger and maintains morale
- **Equipment**: Weapons, armor, and tools for the journey
- **Medicine**: Healing supplies for injuries and illness
- **Gold**: Emergency funds for unexpected needs

**Localized Inventory System**:
- Expeditions must carry all needed items from your home inventory
- Specialized equipment like siege towers must be brought from home
- Magical artifacts and runes provide benefits only if packed for the journey
- No access to home village resources once the expedition departs
- Captured or found items become part of the expedition's portable inventory

**Supply Consumption**:
- Daily consumption based on army size (1 day = 1 tile of travel)
- Weather and terrain affect consumption rates
- Failed hunting or forage attempts increase reliance on carried supplies
- Emergency situations may require rapid supply expenditure

## Morale System

Army morale directly impacts expedition success:

**High Morale Benefits**:
- Better performance in battles
- Reduced chance of desertion
- Improved resistance to negative events
- Higher success rates for hunting and foraging

**Low Morale Consequences**:
- Poor battle performance
- Increased desertion rates
- Vulnerability to negative events
- Possible expedition abandonment

**Morale Factors**:
- **Positive**: Victories, good weather, successful hunts, adequate supplies
- **Negative**: Defeats, harsh conditions, supply shortages, forced marches

## Scout Expeditions

Special reconnaissance missions that:
- **Reveal Map Areas**: Remove fog of war from unexplored regions (only tiles adjacent to your current position)
- **Gather Intelligence**: Learn about enemy strength and resources
- **Find Opportunities**: Discover valuable locations and trade routes
- **Lower Risk**: Smaller, faster forces with reduced detection chance

**Limited Vision System**: You can only see what's immediately around your current position. The world beyond remains shrouded in mystery until you explore it personally or receive reports from other expeditions.

## Map Exploration & Vision

**Fog of War Mechanics**:
- You start with knowledge only of your immediate surroundings
- Each day of travel reveals the tiles adjacent to your current position
- Previously explored areas remain visible on future expeditions
- Map knowledge is persistent and carries forward between expeditions
- Strategic outposts can extend your vision range in their vicinity

## Expedition Infrastructure

**Outpost Construction**:
- Successful expeditions can establish permanent outposts
- Outposts require garrison forces to maintain control
- These serve as supply depots and safe havens for future expeditions
- Advanced outposts can be upgraded to support larger operations

**Settlement Expansion** (Late Game):
- Unlocked through advanced governance technologies
- Civilian expeditions can found entirely new villages
- Requires massive resource investment and population commitment
- New settlements operate semi-independently but remain part of your dynasty

## Expedition Rewards

Successful expeditions can yield:

**Resources**:
- Gold, food, stone, wood, and metal
- Rare materials not available in your territory
- Equipment and weapons for your army

**Strategic Benefits**:
- Map knowledge and exploration progress
- Influence and prestige gains
- Military experience for your forces
- Diplomatic contacts and trade opportunities

**Special Discoveries**:
- Unique locations for future expeditions
- Ancient artifacts with special properties
- New technologies or building blueprints
- Population recruits willing to join your dynasty
- **Strategic Outpost Sites**: Locations ideal for establishing permanent bases
- **Settlement Opportunities**: Areas suitable for founding new villages (late game)

## Strategic Considerations

**Planning Your Expeditions**:
- **Season Timing**: Weather affects travel difficulty
- **Royal Risk Assessment**: Consider the strategic value vs. risk of losing valuable royal family members
- **Economic Impact**: Consider the cost of losing soldiers, supplies, and key leaders
- **Risk vs Reward**: Closer locations are safer but offer smaller rewards
- **Army Composition**: Balance between force strength and expedition speed
- **Inventory Planning**: Carefully select which items and equipment to bring from home

**Managing Your Empire**: 
- Expeditions remove soldiers and royal leaders from home defense
- Supply preparation may strain your economy
- Lost royal family members can destabilize succession planning
- Successful expeditions can dramatically boost your power and territorial control
- Failed expeditions set back your military, economic, and dynastic progress

**Long-term Strategy**:
- Use scout expeditions to safely explore and plan major campaigns
- Establish outpost networks to support deeper exploration
- Build up surplus resources and multiple heirs before attempting high-risk expeditions
- Maintain home defenses while key forces and leaders are away
- Balance territorial expansion with consolidation of existing holdings
- Plan for eventual civilian settlement expeditions to found new villages

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Begin with nearby, low-risk expeditions to learn the system
2. **Prepare Thoroughly**: Bring 20-30% more supplies than the estimated minimum
3. **Monitor Morale**: Don't ignore your army's mental state during long journeys
4. **Choose Battles Wisely**: Not every encounter requires fighting
5. **Plan for Setbacks**: Always have contingency plans for when things go wrong
6. **Learn from Experience**: Each expedition teaches valuable lessons for future campaigns

The expedition system rewards careful planning, strategic thinking, and bold leadership. Master it to transform your small dynasty into a far-reaching empire that dominates the known world.
