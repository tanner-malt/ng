# üîÑ Dynasty & Reset System

## Overview
The Dynasty system is the core progression mechanic where rulers pass down their legacy to heirs, creating continuous gameplay across generations while maintaining all progress and game state.

## üëë Royal Population Management

### Royal Family System
**Separate population manager for royal bloodline:**
- Royal family members tracked independently from village population
- Marriage system requires active player management and spouse selection
- Reproduction tied to diplomatic relationships and strategic alliances
- Royal family growth through births, marriages, and occasional adoptions

### Marriage & Spouse Selection
- **Active Courtship**: Player chooses marriage partners from available candidates
- **Political Alliances**: Strategic marriages with governors, military commanders, or foreign royalty
- **Trait Inheritance**: Genetic combinations affect heir capabilities and specializations
- **Bloodline Management**: Careful breeding for desired skill combinations

### Adoption Opportunities
**Limited adoption available to high-ranking officials:**
- **High-Level Governors**: Can adopt promising civilians into royal line
- **Distinguished Military Commanders**: May adopt war heroes or tactical prodigies

## üß¨ Heir Specializations & Genetics

### Genetic Traits
**Inherited abilities passed through bloodlines:**
- **Magic Potential**: Rare genetic trait that enables supernatural abilities
- **Physical Attributes**: Strength, endurance, and martial prowess inheritance
- **Mental Capabilities**: Intelligence, wisdom, and strategic thinking genes
- **Leadership Charisma**: Natural authority and diplomatic influence

### Royal Skill Development
**Heirs inherit and develop specialized capabilities:**
- Skills are inherited through genetic traits and enhanced through royal education
- Royal family members can develop the same skill categories as the general population
- Heir specializations provide bonuses to related population skills when they rule
- Strategic marriages can introduce new genetic skill potential to the royal bloodline
