This is the game repo for "VILLAGE DEFENSE:Idleo

Idleo is a new genre I am making, there are a few core gameplay loops:

1. Automated battle screen, this is where the interesting parts will occur where you will watch npcs fight. There will be at least one, but could be multiple. 
2. Village screen, this is where you will plan and support the army. You will manage a village, and supply troops, food, and manage the logistics of the town in order to best supply the army.
3. Monarch View, you are sent to the Monarch View every time you die, you will inherit a salary based on how well you performed last time. 
4. Throne View, you are given certain awards for progressing, this will act as a merge mini game. these rewards will be given every time you complete them, which is where you get to merge.
